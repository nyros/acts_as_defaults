This plugin is used to set the default options for Activerecord find method, This is model independent so that you can set any number of filters to any of model.
Steps to install it
1. First install this plugin into your rails application
2. Then add below lines to your model class
Ex1: 
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
default_find_option :order, :age
default_find_option :conditions, "gender = 'male'"
end
So when you call User.find(:all), It will get Users by adding these filters, like "order by age" and gender="male";

Ex2: 
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
default_find_option :order, 'experience DESC'
default_find_option :conditions, "sal > '10000'"

So when you call Employee.find(:all), It will get Employees in the order of experienced employees first and so many conditions you can set for extra filters.
